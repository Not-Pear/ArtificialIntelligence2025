This project was a large undertaking. It's based off Harvards devlopment of PacMan where myself and a parter worked together to make search algorithms that would achieve different goals as efficiently as possible.
There was a constraint that pacman had to pass through a minimum of 1 wall and a max of 2 walls for our search algoritm.
